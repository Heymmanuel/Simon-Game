3. Press any key on your keyboard to start the game.
4. Pay attention to the sequence of colors and sounds played by Simon.
5. Repeat the sequence by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.
6. The game will continue to add new colors to the sequence with each level.
7. If you make a mistake, the game will end. Press any key to restart.

## Features

- Interactive buttons that light up and play sounds in response to user clicks.
